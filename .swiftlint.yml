# By default, SwiftLint uses a set of sensible default rules you can adjust:
disabled_rules: # rule identifiers turned on by default to exclude from running
#  - file_length
#  - type_body_length
#  - nesting
  - identifier_name
  - line_length

excluded: # paths to ignore during linting. Takes precedence over `included`.
  - Pods
  - R.generated.swift
  - .build

force_cast: warning # implicitly
force_try:
